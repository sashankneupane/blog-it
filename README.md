# Simple Blog Site

[ait-project.sashankneupane.com](http://ait-project.sashankneupane.com)

## Overview

The blogsite will be a platform for people to write and share blogs to the world. The site will support all creation, update, and deletion of existing/new blogs from the site itself. The site will also support user authentication.

Only authenticated users can write blogs and blogs written by a user can be seen in their profile page. Authenticated users can also view all blogs written by other users in the home page.

## Data Model

The application will store Users and Blogs.

- users can have multiple blogs (via references)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "shannonshopper",
  email: // a valid email address,
  hash: // a password hash,
  name: "Shannon Shopper",
  blogs: // an array of references to Blog documents
}
```

An Example Blogpost with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  author: // a reference to a User object
  title: "Why is Javascript so hard?",
  content: "I've been trying to learn Javascript for the past 2 years and I still don't understand it."
  timestamp: // timestamp
}
```
